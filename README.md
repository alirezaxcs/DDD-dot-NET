# Expert Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Implementation in .NET ASP.NET Core 9


## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a domain-driven design (DDD) approach to building a Management domain model. The project follows best practices for defining entities, value objects, aggregates, domain events, and infrastructure layers.

## Defining and Implementing Entities and Value Objects
- Creating the initial project for the Management domain model
- Implementing an entity
- Refactoring the logic into an entity base class
- Encapsulating and protecting entity state
- Avoiding the primitive obsession anti-pattern
- Implementing a value object for a pet's weight
- Implementing a second entity for pet breeds
- Invoking a domain service in a value object
- Implementing business rules in the Pet entity
- Implementing implicit operators in value objects

## Defining and Implementing Aggregates
- Refactoring the solution to add a shared kernel mapping
- Adding necessary properties to the aggregate
- Implementing logic in the aggregate to end a consultation
- Implementing behavior to manage drugs
- Implementing behavior to record multiple vital sign readings
- Unit testing the aggregate

## Implementing the Infrastructure Layer
- Creating the `ManagementDbContext`
- Configuring type and property mappings in the `DbContext`
- Registering the `DbContext` in the dependency injection container
- Refactoring the code into a repository interface and class

## Implementing the Application Layer
- Implementing the `ManagementApplicationService` class
- Persisting data in the `ManagementApplicationService` class
- Rehydrating persisted entities and invoking their behavior
- Creating a command handler interface for handling commands
- Implementing the Clinic API
- Refactoring the consultation date and time

## Implementing Domain Events
- Implementing domain events
- Publishing domain events
- Subscribing to domain events

## Mixing the Event Sourcing Pattern with DDD
- Refactoring the `AggregateRoot` class for tracking events
- Implementing the first domain event to be tracked
- Implementing more domain events related to the consultation
- Refactoring the `DbContext` for handling domain events
- Persisting domain events in the database
- Loading domain events from the database

## Conclusion
- Next steps in Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
